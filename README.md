# MiniShell â€“ A Simple POSIX-like Shell in C

`MiniShell` is a lightweight shell written in C that emulates key features of common POSIX shells like `bash` or `sh`. It supports job control, built-in commands, background execution, and more â€” all implemented from scratch using low-level system calls.

## Features

- ðŸ”¹ **Built-in commands**:
  - `cd` â€“ Change directory
  - `pwd` â€“ Print working directory
  - `echo` â€“ Display messages or variables
  - `fg`, `bg` â€“ Foreground/background job control
  - `jobs` â€“ List active background/stopped jobs

- ðŸ”¹ **External command execution** using `execvp()`

- ðŸ”¹ **Background execution** using `&`

- ðŸ”¹ **Signal handling**:
  - `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) â€” Interrupt foreground process
  - `Ctrl+Z` (SIGTSTP) â€” Suspend foreground process
  - Background job reaping using `SIGCHLD`

- ðŸ”¹ **Command prompt customization** via `PS1` environment variable

- ðŸ”¹ **Accurate exit status** reporting with `$?` like in standard shells
